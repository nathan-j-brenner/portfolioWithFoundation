	          	<p>Alan Moore said &ldquo;All we ever see of stars are their old photographs.&rdquo; I grew up in a bright town where I rarely saw the stars, so the times I have are fond memories.  I've worn a lot of hats in the last decade.  I've been a soldier, a musician, a teacher, a husband, a father. Each role I played stands out like a single star.  When I look out at the night sky, I don't see one individual star, just like I don't consider myself defined by any single attribute.
	          	</p>
	          	<p>
	          	I'm currently looking for employment as a full time junior web developer. I've been developing my coding skills primarily from <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/">Portland Code School</a> over the last several months and I'm currently taking the <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/javascriptimmersion/">JavaScript Immersion course</a> with the hope that along with the education I'll create a network that can put me in the path of employment.
	          	</p>
	          	<p>
	          	I have a core set of values: Integrity, honesty, accountability, creativity, and collaboration.  
	          	</p>
	          	<p>
	          	My first teaching job was in a tiny town, and the staff used Google docs.  It took me most of the year to figure out that technology.  Before that time, I used computers mostly for writing papers and I was proud that I could typically take any new software and figure out how to use it.  A few months ago I chose to leave public education. My primary focus right now is technology.  Check out my web presence on some of the sites on this page and decide for yourself if my current skillset can meet your needs.

				<h4>Recent Projects</h4>
				<p>In the last three months, I have had several projects that focused on other parts of the full stack outside of the front end. All of them are on gitHub, and it's probably easiest to tell you about what I learned from them.</p>

						<p>When I met the people at Portland Code School, I told them about my credentials in education, and they provided me an oppertunity to learn to code while working as an Instructional Designer for their Web Foundations Series.  On this website, I created and revised lesson plans, the syllabus, and the project guidelines.</p>

						<p>This was the final project I worked on as a student in the Web Foundations Series at Portland Code School.  I took a site that I had built with a team and replaced some of the features such as the feedback form with javaScript (click on the success button".  The last thing I added to this site was a recording of Stravinky's Rite of Spring; that piece always reminds me of Disney's Fantasia so it seemed to fit the theme.</p>

						<p>This was the first website I built from scratch.  This was also a group project. Notice the fixed header, the contact form, and the imbeded iframes google form and map.  My biggest contrabution to this project was getting the rest of the team onboard with gitHub.  We also used <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> as a way to communicate and setup deadlines.</p>
